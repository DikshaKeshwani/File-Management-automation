# Automated File Management with Python

## Overview

This project provides an automated file management system built using Python. The system is designed to help users organize, sort, and manage files in a specified directory based on various criteria such as file type, date created, and size. The goal is to simplify file organization and improve productivity by automating repetitive file management tasks.

## Features

- **File Sorting**: Automatically sorts files into designated folders based on file type (e.g., images, documents, videos).
- **Date-Based Organization**: Organizes files into folders based on their creation date (e.g., year/month).
- **Size-Based Management**: Identifies and moves large files to a separate folder for easy management.
- **Customizable Rules**: Users can define their own rules for file organization.
- **Logging**: Maintains a log of all actions taken by the script for auditing purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `os`
  - `shutil`
  - `datetime`
  - `logging`

You can install any additional required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install <library-name>
```
## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-file-management.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd automated-file-management
```
3. Install any required libraries (if applicable).

## Usage
1. Open the file_manager.py script in your preferred code editor.

2. Configure the parameters at the top of the script, such as the source directory and destination directories.

3. Run the script:
```bash
python file_manager.py
```
4. Check the destination directories for organized files.

## Example Configuration
```python
SOURCE_DIR = '/path/to/source/directory'
DEST_DIR_IMAGES = '/path/to/destination/images'
DEST_DIR_DOCUMENTS = '/path/to/destination/documents'
DEST_DIR_VIDEOS = '/path/to/destination/videos'
```

## Logging
The script logs all actions taken during execution. The log file can be found in the project directory as file_management.log.
